Please complete a full and final localization audit for the Simplified Chinese (zh-CN) language version of the MetaNord website, including both static and dynamic content. Despite previous attempts, there are still major English sections remaining across the site.

Please do the following:

1. Perform a deep scan across all pages (public + admin if applicable) and identify any of the following:
	•	Raw English text
	•	Untranslated product names or descriptions
	•	Missing localized i18n keys (fallbacks or missing entries)
	•	Mixed-language blocks (e.g. Chinese + English combined)

2. Fully translate the following high-priority sections which are still not localized:
	•	“About Us” section on homepage and /about page
	•	“Why Choose Us” section
	•	Full /products page and all individual product cards (name + description)
	•	Full /services page including:
	•	Service blocks (titles + descriptions)
	•	Icons
	•	“Our Service Process” (step titles + descriptions)
	•	Contact form at bottom of homepage
	•	Full /contact page
	•	All filter buttons and categories on /projects and /documents
	•	Section titles like:
	•	“Customer-Centric Approach”
	•	“Our Story”
	•	“Industry Experience”
	•	“Sustainability”
	•	“Procurement Services”
	•	“Additional Services”
	•	Buttons like “Learn More”, “View Details”, “Request Quote”, “Browse Product Catalog”

3. Validate the following technical actions:
	•	Check if zh-CN keys are properly linked in i18n config
	•	Ensure all translations exist in zh-CN.json or nested locale files
	•	Verify translations render correctly and immediately after switching to Chinese
	•	No layout or design is broken after the translation

4. Optional (nice-to-have):
	•	If translations are dynamically injected (CMS or DB), ensure fallback logic uses correct zh-CN content
	•	Ensure SEO meta tags and page titles are also localized for zh-CN

5. Once complete:
	•	Confirm and list all updated sections
	•	Share a quick audit summary showing any parts that could not be localized (if any)
