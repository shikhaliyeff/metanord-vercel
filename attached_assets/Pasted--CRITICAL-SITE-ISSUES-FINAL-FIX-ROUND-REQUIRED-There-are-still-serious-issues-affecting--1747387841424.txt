⚠️ CRITICAL SITE ISSUES — FINAL FIX ROUND REQUIRED ⚠️

There are still **serious issues** affecting the MetaNord site — especially on the Products page and dropdown menus. Please investigate and **fully fix** the following:

---

🔍 1. PRODUCTS PAGE NOT DISPLAYING
The `/products` route **still does not show any products** in **any language**. However, the product cards do render correctly on the homepage.

✅ This means:
- The product data exists and loads properly elsewhere
- The problem is **specific to how the products are rendered on the full /products page**

🔧 Please deeply investigate the logic used on the Products page:
- Check the useEffect or rendering logic
- Check if language-specific keys (e.g., `zh-CN`) are breaking rendering
- Confirm that product filtering or category matching isn’t causing 0 results
- Make sure fallback/defaults are correctly implemented

✅ This page must load product cards correctly and fully in all languages.

🎨 2. DROPDOWN MENU VISUAL FIX
Right now the dropdown (submenu) still looks **unbalanced and awkward**. The font gets lost over some page sections, especially when scrolling.

🔧 Please apply the following minimal design fix:
- Add a **subtle white background** (with light transparency, e.g. `rgba(255,255,255,0.9)`)
- Remove or minimize the padding and margin to make it tight and elegant
- Keep the hover underline effect consistent with the main nav items
- Make sure the submenu looks clean and readable on all scroll positions

This needs to be polished and visually consistent with the site’s design.

🧠 3. FINAL REVIEW & RENDER AUDIT
Please carefully go through all site pages:
- Homepage
- Products
- About
- Services
- Contact

And confirm:
- Translations are properly rendered (no `[object Object]`, double words, raw tags)
- Components appear on screen (no blank pages)
- Submenus work as expected
- Products load across languages

Do **not** mark this as resolved until the above issues are 100% fixed.

🙏 This is a final and critical polish step. Please proceed carefully and test your changes thoroughly.

Thank you!
