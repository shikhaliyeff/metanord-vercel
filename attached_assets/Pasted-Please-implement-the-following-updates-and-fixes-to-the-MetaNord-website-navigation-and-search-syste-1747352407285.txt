Please implement the following updates and fixes to the MetaNord website navigation and search system to improve UX, accessibility, and visual consistency:

---

### 1. Language Selector Simplification

- Remove the language code or label (e.g., "EN", "RU", etc.) from the language selector in the header.
- Display only the flag icon of the currently selected language.
- Maintain the existing dropdown switcher on click.
- Ensure alignment and spacing remain consistent across desktop and mobile.

---

### 2. Enable Submenu Dropdowns on Hover (Desktop)

- Change dropdown behavior for “Solutions” and “Company” menu items:
  - On **desktop**, submenus should open on hover (no click required).
  - Apply smooth fade or slide animation.
  - Use ~200ms delay on hover-out to allow natural cursor movement.
  - On **mobile**, keep current click/tap behavior.
- Ensure this interaction works across Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

---

### 3. Fix Submenu Readability (Hover Style)

- Currently, when hovering over submenu items, the text becomes hard to read due to poor color contrast (e.g., green background with light text).
- Please update submenu styling for proper visual contrast:
  - Use a **light background** (`#fff` or similar)
  - Use **dark or brand-color text**
  - Apply soft accent only to the active or hovered item (e.g., `hover:text-accent`, `hover:bg-gray-100`)
- Make sure all hover states remain consistent with the site's design system.

---

### 4. Fix Scrolling Issue While Dropdown Is Open

- Currently, when a dropdown menu is open, the page cannot be scrolled vertically.
- Fix this so that users can freely scroll the page even when hovering over or interacting with the dropdown.

---

### 5. Fix Header Search Dropdown Layout Bug

- When clicking the search icon, the dropdown displaying results has a rendering issue:
  - Images or content previews in the dropdown are **cut off or cropped**.
- Please fix the layout so that:
  - All images and text in the search suggestions are fully visible
  - The container adjusts dynamically (auto-height or scrollable if needed)
  - The dropdown is aligned properly with padding and spacing
  - The layout remains clean and responsive across all screen sizes

---

Test all of the above changes on desktop and mobile breakpoints, and make sure the visual styling matches the existing MetaNord design system (typography, colors, spacing, icon style, shadows).

Please provide a preview for review before publishing the changes.
