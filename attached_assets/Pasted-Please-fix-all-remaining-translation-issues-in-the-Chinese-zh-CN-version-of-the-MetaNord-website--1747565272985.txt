Please fix all remaining translation issues in the Chinese (zh-CN) version of the MetaNord website. Many sections are still untranslated or partially translated. This includes but is not limited to:

1. HOMEPAGE
- "Request a Quote Today", "Ready to Start Your Project?", and all surrounding paragraph texts are still in English.
- The feature bullets (e.g. "Expert consultation", "Competitive pricing", etc.) are still in English.
- Button texts like "Browse Product Catalog" are not translated.
- Some call-to-action blocks (e.g. “Need assistance with your project?”) are partially translated.

2. ABOUT PAGE
- "Our Vision", "Our Story", and surrounding paragraph texts are still in English.
- Section headings like "Industry Experience", "Sustainability", "Customer-Centric Approach" must be translated.
- Numerical stats ("15+ European Countries", etc.) need their titles translated.

3. PROJECTS PAGE
- Headings such as "Featured Projects" and "Discover our past and ongoing..." must be translated.
- Category filters (All Projects, Infrastructure, Commercial) are untranslated.
- Empty state messages like “No projects found” and “Try a different filter category” are still in English.
- Button “View All Projects” is untranslated.
- Some project cards show translated categories but not titles or descriptions.

4. CONTACT PAGE
- Title "Reach Out" and section subtitles are untranslated.
- Labels like "Company", "Registry Code", "Address", and "Phone" should be translated to Chinese (not just the values).

5. SERVICES SECTION
- Some cards show headings in English ("Technical Consulting") and inner text also in English (e.g. "Product specifications and compatibility", etc.)
- Ensure all bullet points and CTA buttons are also translated.

6. GENERAL REMINDER
- Ensure translations are correctly pulled from zh-CN.json file and are not hardcoded.
- Do not break or alter translations for other languages.
- Do not change product or FAQ translations – these are already working well.

7. SLIDER INDICATOR STYLING (Hero section)
- On mobile, the slider still shows the old fat circular indicators (pagination dots).
- This must be replaced with the updated slimmer, more modern indicators already used in the desktop version.
- Make sure both desktop and mobile views use the same updated indicator styling.

Please confirm that all of the above are implemented and working. Then, and only then, continue with the rest of the optimization work from the Instructions.md plan.
