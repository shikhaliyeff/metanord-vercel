⚠️ URGENT FIX NEEDED – PRODUCTS PAGE STILL BROKEN ⚠️  
🔁 DROPDOWN MENU STILL CLUTTERED – NEEDS POLISH  

Please stop applying partial fixes and fully investigate the following:

---

❗️1. PRODUCTS PAGE – COMPLETELY BLANK  
The /products page **still does not load**.  
Not in Chinese, not in English, not in any language.  

👉 The homepage renders products correctly, so the data source is working.  
This means the issue lies in the `/products` page's **render logic**, not the data itself.

Please:

- Deeply trace the `ProductsPage` or its component render logic  
- Confirm product `map()` logic works with `i18n`  
- Verify fallback/default locale behavior  
- Look for failed `useEffect` or `data fetching` conditions  
- Add logging or debugging if necessary  
- Check layout/components wrappers — maybe rendering is blocked silently  

✅ This is a **critical site function**. No further edits should be made until this is resolved.

🎯 2. DROPDOWN MENU – STILL UGLY  

The submenu now renders with white background (good), but:
- The vertical padding is excessive  
- There’s too much space between lines  
- Text alignment and spacing look unbalanced  
- Menu overlaps other elements awkwardly  

Please:

- Reduce `padding` and `margin` on submenu items  
- Adjust `line-height` and spacing for tighter, cleaner look  
- Add a **subtle shadow** (`box-shadow`) and rounded corners (`border-radius`)  
- Make it visually consistent with the main menu  
- Keep hover underline effect matching the main nav links  

🎨 Design should be elegant, compact, and modern — not oversized or blocky.

📋 3. GLOBAL CHECKLIST BEFORE CLOSING  
Before marking this resolved, please verify:  
- `/products` page fully loads and displays product cards  
- All language versions work  
- Dropdown menus are polished and minimalistic  
- No layout shift or element overflow on any screen size  
- Product data renders in all locales  
- No more `[object Object]` or untranslated UI strings  
- Menu and submenu are pixel-perfect aligned with brand aesthetic

🚨 This is a business-critical issue.  
Please proceed slowly and validate each fix carefully before moving to the next.

Thanks.
