Please implement an internal CRM module directly into the current MetaNord admin console. This should allow full in-house client and lead management functionality — no external CRM platforms involved.

Here’s what I need:

---

🧾 1. Contact & Client Profiles

- Automatically create a client profile whenever a new Contact or Quote Inquiry is submitted.
- Profiles should include:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone (if available)
  - Company
  - Country
  - Inquiry type (contact / quote)
  - Products referenced (if any)
  - Submission date
  - Lead status (default: "New")
- Enable filtering and search by name, company, country, or product.

---

🛠 2. CRM Pipeline (Kanban View)

- Add a visual CRM pipeline page with stages:
  - New
  - In Progress
  - Proposal Sent
  - Awaiting Response
  - Closed
- Each client profile can be moved between stages (drag-and-drop or dropdown).
- Display lead counts per stage and overall stats at the top.

---

🗒 3. Internal Notes & History

- In each client profile, add:
  - Internal note section (editable, multiline)
  - Action log (timestamped events like stage change, message sent, etc.)
  - Field for “next action” or follow-up

---

📧 4. Email from Admin (SendGrid integration)

- Enable sending manual responses directly from client profiles
- Use SendGrid or existing email setup to send:
  - one-off messages
  - saved templates (e.g., "Thank you", "Proposal sent", "Follow-up")
- Store email log per client (date, subject, status)

---

📆 5. Follow-up Reminders

- Let admin set follow-up reminders per client:
  - “Follow up in 2 days”, “Call next week”, etc.
- Create a “Today’s Tasks” section on the CRM Dashboard
- Optional: send email reminders to admin or just list them in the panel

---

📤 6. Export / Import of Clients

- Add CSV and JSON export for client list with all details
- Allow admin to import new leads from file (optional)

---

📊 7. CRM Analytics

- Display:
  - Total leads
  - Leads per stage
  - Average lead lifetime per stage
  - Top-requested products
- Use simple charts (bar/pie/line)

---

🔒 8. Role Permissions

- Only Admins can delete or export leads
- Editors can edit profiles and send messages
- Viewers have read-only access

---

🧩 Notes:

- Store all client data in a structured file: `clients.json`
- Make the interface match the current admin UI visually
- Use tabs or a CRM section in the sidebar to access this module
- Allow linking back to original inquiry (quote/contact)

Please begin implementing these features in logical order. Let me know if you need a JSON schema for client profiles or UI suggestions for the CRM pipeline.
