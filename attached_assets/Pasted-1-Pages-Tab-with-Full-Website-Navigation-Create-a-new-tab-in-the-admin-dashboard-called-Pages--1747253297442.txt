1. Pages Tab with Full Website Navigation

Create a new tab in the admin dashboard called **"Pages"**.

This should:

- Display a list of all public-facing pages (e.g., index.html, about.html, contact.html, products.html)
- For each page, show its editable content sections (linked to content.json, hero.json, etc.)
- Allow switching between pages inside the admin panel

---

🖼 2. Live Preview Integration

- Display an `<iframe>` preview for each page selected in the Pages tab
- The preview must reflect current live JSON data from the admin (not static HTML)
- Allow switching between preview and edit modes

---

🌐 3. Dynamic JSON Integration

Ensure the frontend pages load content from JSON via client-side JavaScript:
- `hero.json` → homepage Hero
- `products.json` → product listings
- `content.json` → About, Contact, Certificates, Footer, etc.

Changes in admin should instantly reflect on the live site.

  - Save the inquiry in the admin dashboard
  - Email the full message to: **info@metanord.eu**
  - Include: name, email, subject (if any), message body, timestamp
