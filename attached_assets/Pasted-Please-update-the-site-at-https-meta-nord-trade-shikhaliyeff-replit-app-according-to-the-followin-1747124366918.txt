Please update the site at https://meta-nord-trade-shikhaliyeff.replit.app/ according to the following requirements:

1. **Sticky Navbar**  
   - Make the header/navbar stick to the top of the viewport on scroll.
   - Ensure menu links and logo remain visible and clickable at all times.

2. **Anchor Links & CTAs**  
   - Convert all menu items and “Learn More” buttons to jump to in-page anchors.
   - Add prominent CTA buttons (“Get Price”, “Download Price List”) in the hero and product sections.

3. **Color Palette & Typography**  
   - Define and apply a consistent primary (branded blue) and secondary (dark gray) palette.
   - Use no more than two fonts: one for headings (bold, sans-serif) and one for body text.
   - Ensure base font size is at least 16 px and line-height ≥ 1.5.

4. **Whitespace & Layout**  
   - Increase padding/margins between sections and within product cards.

   - Add category filters or tabs (e.g., “Industrial”, “Facade”, “Architectural”) above the grid.

5. **Hero Section Enhancement**  
   - Replace static background with a full-width image slider or looping video showcasing aluminum profiles.
   - Craft a clear headline and subheadline:  
     “Premium Aluminum Profiles from Europe”  
     “Own production • Fast lead times • Worldwide delivery”
   - Include two buttons: primary “Get Price” and secondary “Learn More”.

6. **Mobile Responsiveness**  
   - Collapse the menu into a burger icon on narrow viewports.

   - Implement a modal “Request Callback” form with name, phone, and message fields.
   - After submission, show a “Thank you!” confirmation and link to download the price list.
   - Integrate a live chat widget or WhatsApp button in the corner.

10. **Accessibility Improvements**  
    - Add `alt` attributes to all images.
    - Verify text/background contrast meets WCAG 4.5:1.
    - Ensure visible focus outlines for keyboard navigation.

11. **Analytics & Monitoring**  
    - Insert Google Analytics (or Yandex.Metrika) script in the `<head>`.
