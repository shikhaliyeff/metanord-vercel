Before continuing, please pause and thoroughly re-analyze everything that has been requested so far.

Some of the earlier instructions may have been skipped, implemented partially, or inconsistently.

Please now do the following:

---

🔁 1. Instruction Revision

- Go back and carefully review all previous prompts I’ve given, especially:
  - Sidebar restructuring
  - Notification bell
  - Unified dark mode (admin only)
  - Full audit of site functionality, language coverage, and visual behavior

- Create a checklist with:
  - ✅ Fully completed tasks
  - ⚠️ Partially completed or skipped items
  - ❌ Missing or misaligned features

- Correct any gaps or unfinished steps, even minor styling issues or inconsistencies.

🎥 2. Simulated Visual/Behavioral Audit (Full QA Walkthrough)

Please now perform a full audit of the entire system — both the public-facing site and the admin panel — as if you were doing a video walkthrough or interactive demo review.

What to check:

📄 **Public Website:**
- Are all pages accessible? (/, /products, /projects, /contact)
- Do all buttons and links work correctly? (e.g., “View Project”)
- Is layout consistent across languages?
- Are there any broken styles, unaligned components, or flickering on dark/light transitions?

🌐 **Language Coverage:**
- Are all languages (EN, RU, ET, LV, LT, PL) fully populated in hero, products, projects, buttons, etc.?
- Are there fallback issues or untranslated blocks?
- Does the language switcher correctly load the right data?

🧭 **Admin Panel:**
- Do all sections open, collapse, and function smoothly?
- Is dark mode fully consistent and scoped only to admin?
- Is the notification bell working as described?
- Are CRM, Offers, and Projects editors all saving and reflecting correctly?

🧾 **Visual Bugs or Console Errors:**
- Check for layout glitches, overlapping elements, console warnings
- Look for incomplete input validations, non-responsive buttons, or scroll issues

✅ Final Confirmation

After completing both the instruction revision and full audit walkthrough:

- Provide a categorized checklist of all findings
- Fix anything missing or inconsistent
- Confirm explicitly that all prior instructions — in both logic and UI/UX — are fully done and tested
- Only proceed to new tasks once this is complete
