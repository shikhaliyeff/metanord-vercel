There are multiple critical bugs and UI/UX issues, especially in the mobile version. Please fix them all immediately and permanently — this is very urgent. Here is a clear list of issues:

1. Products Page (Mobile) — Critical
- The Products page does not load in any language on mobile devices.
- When it does load partially, “Quick View” and “View Details” popups appear in broken or random locations.
- Product data still loads incorrectly in certain languages (e.g. Chinese, Polish, Lithuanian).
- Make the entire product page fully functional and responsive on mobile, with stable translations and layout.

2. Translation and Data Issues
- On the /services page in Chinese, the header shows {{services}} instead of a proper translation.
- FAQ page on Chinese version shows English content and broken layout.
- Ensure ALL dynamic content is translated properly in ALL 6 languages (especially Chinese).
- Fix missing translations in product cards, buttons, and descriptions.

3. Mobile Navigation & Menu
- When switching from Chinese to another language, the site freezes for a few seconds. Fix this performance bug.
- Product or any internal page opens at the bottom (footer) instead of the top. Fix scroll-to-top on route change.
- In mobile menu and dropdowns, remove icons next to submenu items (this affects design clarity).
- Ensure dropdown menus are visually compact and minimal — match the desktop version’s recent improvements.

4. Visual Bugs
- Some popup windows (Quick View, Product Details) overlay incorrectly on mobile. They should center properly and stay within viewport.
- The FAQ page shows black gradients covering text — completely breaks usability.
- On some pages, elements overlap (e.g. floating buttons over text or image).

Your task:
- Carefully re-check each language, each view (mobile + desktop), and each product/page.
- Follow the same logic you applied earlier to fix the desktop version’s product page — apply this to mobile and localized versions.
- Optimize all UI components for performance, scrolling, and language switching.
- Test everything thoroughly and confirm 100% functionality and clean design across all breakpoints and locales.
