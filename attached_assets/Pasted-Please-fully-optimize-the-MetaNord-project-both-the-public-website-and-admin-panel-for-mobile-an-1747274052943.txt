Please fully optimize the MetaNord project ‚Äî both the public website and admin panel ‚Äî for mobile and tablet devices.

This includes both layout, interaction, and responsiveness across screen sizes.

---

üì± 1. Public Website (Frontend) ‚Äî Mobile Optimization

- Ensure all pages (`/`, `/products`, `/projects`, `/contact`) are fully responsive and work smoothly on mobile screens.
- Implement responsive breakpoints (using Tailwind or CSS media queries) to handle:
  - Hero section scaling (text and CTA buttons stack correctly)
  - Product grid/cards: switch to 1-column or 2-column layouts on mobile
  - Project cards, CTA buttons, contact form inputs
  - Navbar: use hamburger menu on small screens with smooth toggle
  - Footer elements stack vertically

- Prevent horizontal scrolling or overflow on any page
- Ensure tap targets (buttons, inputs, nav items) are large enough and spaced correctly
- All embedded forms (quote request, contact) must be mobile-friendly
- Optimize font sizes and padding/margins for small viewports

üßë‚Äçüíº 2. Admin Panel ‚Äî Mobile Adaptation

- Make the entire admin dashboard usable from smartphones and tablets:
  - Responsive sidebar (can collapse or use bottom nav on mobile)
  - Tabbed sections adapt to vertical space (accordion layout or tab drawer)
  - Form inputs scale and wrap correctly
  - Buttons and controls are large enough to use by touch
  - Tables (e.g. product lists) become scrollable or stacked in mobile view
  - Avoid modal overflow or fixed-width panels that don't shrink

- Optimize touch interactions: dropdowns, toggles, previews
- Keep Live Preview components readable and scrollable on mobile

---

üß™ 3. Testing & Validation

- Ensure full compatibility with breakpoints:
  - Mobile (‚â§ 768px), Tablet (768‚Äì1024px), Desktop (‚â• 1024px)
- Use developer tools to test across simulated devices (iPhone, Android, iPad)
- No scrollbars or layout bugs should appear in mobile view
- Navigation and interaction must remain fully usable on touchscreens

---

‚úÖ Final Deliverables:

- Fully mobile-responsive public site
- Fully mobile-optimized admin panel interface
- No broken layouts, overflow, or hidden elements on any screen
- Confirm visually and functionally that all components work as intended
