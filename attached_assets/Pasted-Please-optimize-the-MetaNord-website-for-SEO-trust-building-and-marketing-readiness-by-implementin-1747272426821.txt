Please optimize the MetaNord website for SEO, trust-building, and marketing readiness by implementing the following features:

---

üîç 1. SEO Meta Tag Optimization (per page)

- Ensure that each major page (`/`, `/products`, `/projects`, `/contact`) includes:
  - Unique and relevant `<title>` tags
  - Descriptive `<meta name="description">` tags
  - `<link rel="canonical">` tags to avoid duplicates
  - Proper `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">` where applicable
  - `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url` for social previews

Make sure these are dynamic if multilingual versions exist.

---

üß© 2. Structured Data (Schema.org with JSON-LD)

Implement structured data tags to improve SEO visibility in search engines.

- Use JSON-LD format in `<head>` of each page
- Implement the following types:
  - `Organization` (MetaNord company info)
  - `Product` (on product pages, with name, brand, material, availability)
  - `BreadcrumbList` (for navigation structure)
  - `WebPage` or `WebSite` for general metadata

Ensure the data matches visible content and multilingual context where appropriate.

---

üìÑ 3. Downloadable Documents Section

Add a new section called **Downloads** or **Documents & Certifications**, accessible from the footer or top nav.

- Include downloadable PDF files:
  - Company presentation / overview
  - Product brochures
  - ISO/CE certificates
  - Technical datasheets

Allow these documents to be uploaded via the admin panel if possible.

---

üìà 4. Google Tag Manager Integration (GTM)

- Add GTM container code in the site `<head>` and `<body>` as required
- Allow dynamic insertion of tags via GTM for future analytics or advertising

---

üéØ 5. Analytics Event Tracking

Implement basic conversion/event tracking support:

- Trigger events for:
  - Quote form submissions
  - Contact form submissions
  - Clicks on primary CTA buttons
  - Downloads from the Documents section

These can use `dataLayer.push()` for GTM or native tracking hooks.

---

‚úÖ Final Notes:

- Ensure all implementations are compatible with multilingual support
- Do not break the visual layout or structure of the site
- Confirm when each section is complete
- Validate all SEO enhancements using tools like Google Rich Results Test or Lighthouse if possible

Let me know when the marketing and SEO optimization is complete and tested.
