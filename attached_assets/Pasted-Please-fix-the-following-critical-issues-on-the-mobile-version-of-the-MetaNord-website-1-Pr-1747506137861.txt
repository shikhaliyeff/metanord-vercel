Please fix the following **critical issues** on the mobile version of the MetaNord website:

1. **Products page does not load** at all on mobile — in any language version.
2. **Switching from Chinese to any other language** causes the entire mobile interface to freeze for a few seconds.
3. **Some products appear broken or not at all** in mobile view, especially when switching categories or languages.
4. **Quick View modal** appears misaligned or detached from the product card.
5. **View Details pages open at the bottom of the screen (near footer)** instead of scrolling to the top.
6. **Several translations are missing**, especially in Lithuanian, Polish, and Chinese.
7. The **Chinese version of the Services page** was previously showing `{{object Object}}` or `[object Object]` — please ensure this and similar issues are resolved sitewide.
8. The **FAQ page is broken on mobile** — layout glitches, cut-off content, unreadable elements.
9. **FAQ page is not translated** into Chinese — it still shows English content under Chinese heading.
10. **On mobile**, individual product detail pages show overlapping or broken elements (see screenshots).
11. The **Contact and FAQ pages** have untranslated or misaligned content in several languages.
12. Please **remove all icons next to submenu items** in dropdowns if they reappear (already fixed in desktop, double-check mobile).

**CRITICAL PRIORITY:**  
Fix the **Products page** on mobile **first**, as it is completely non-functional across all languages. Ensure products load reliably, translations apply, and UI is responsive.

**Final Checklist:**
- Fully test all fixes on **real mobile view (especially iPhone Safari/Chrome)**.
- Test all language versions, categories, and product detail modals.
- Eliminate all leftover placeholders like `{{services}}`, `{{object}}`, or `[object Object]`.
- Validate proper scrolling behavior, modal alignment, and clean layout across all pages.
- Ensure translations are fetched properly, especially for **product names, filters, and FAQs**.

Please treat this as a complete pass for mobile optimization and multilingual QA. Let me know when it’s all fully resolved and tested.
