Please implement the following upgrades to the MetaNord Admin Panel to improve structure, visual consistency, and user feedback — while keeping the public site unaffected.

---

🔧 1. Sidebar Navigation Restructure

Group and simplify sidebar navigation as follows:

1. **Dashboard**

2. **Content** (Collapsible group)
   - Pages (merge Hero, Website Pages, and Site Content)
   - Products
   - Projects (Featured Projects / Case Studies)

3. **CRM** (Collapsible group)
   - Leads (combine Contact Inquiries + Quote Requests)
   - CRM (Client Profiles, pipeline, notes)
   - Offers
   - Notifications (CRM-related only)
   - Analytics
   - Audit Logs

4. **System**
   - User Management
   - (Optional: global settings)

Use collapsible groups with consistent iconography. Goal: minimize clutter and improve functional grouping.

🔔 2. Global Notification Bell

Add a bell icon to the top-right corner of the admin interface (header).

Functionality:

- Show unread notification count badge
- Clicking the bell opens a dropdown showing recent notifications:
  - Icon, title/message, timestamp
  - Examples: “New quote request”, “Offer sent”, “Client status updated”
  - Optional link to related CRM item
- Actions:
  - ✅ Mark as read
  - ❌ Dismiss
- Store read/unread status locally
- Notification sources: CRM activity (new leads, offers, status changes, tasks)

🌒 3. Unified and Isolated Dark Mode (Admin Panel Only)

- Refactor dark mode to use a clean, unified **dark-gray theme** (no pure black)
  - Suggested base: `#1E1E1E` to `#2A2A2A`, Tailwind’s `gray-800` / `gray-900`
  - Apply consistently to backgrounds, cards, sidebars, buttons, dropdowns
  - Ensure text remains readable (light gray or white with contrast)
  - Avoid mixing `#000` and `#333` together

✅ **Important:**  
Dark Mode should only apply to the **admin panel**, not to the public website or the preview site view.  
Make sure there is **clear separation of styling scopes** — the public site must remain light regardless of admin theme.

---

📎 Notes:

- Preserve all multilingual logic and layout consistency
- Dark Mode toggle can be remembered via localStorage
- Keep public site preview clean and unaffected

Let me know once complete or if you need visual references or preferred Tailwind color codes.
