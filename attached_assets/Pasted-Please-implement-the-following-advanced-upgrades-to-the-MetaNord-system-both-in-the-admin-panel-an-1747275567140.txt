Please implement the following advanced upgrades to the MetaNord system — both in the admin panel and user-facing functionality — to improve page management, CRM depth, task tracking, filtering, and overall usability.

---

🎨 1. Visual Page Builder (Drag & Drop from Templates)

Transform the "Templates" (formerly Themes) section into a real **Visual Page Builder**:

- Admin can create a new custom page by:
  - Selecting layout blocks from template library (e.g., Hero, Gallery, Features)
  - Dragging blocks into the page canvas (sortable order)
  - Editing each block’s text, images, buttons
  - Previewing the page live
  - Saving the page (writes to `content.json` or relevant file)

- Blocks should follow MetaNord design styles
- Each page must support multilingual content per block
- Saved pages should be viewable in the Pages tab or public frontend if enabled

---

📂 2. Tagging & Filtering System (for Products and Projects)

Add flexible tagging and filtering options to Products and Featured Projects:

- Allow admin to define tags like:
  - Industry (Construction, Energy, Infrastructure)
  - Region (Baltic, Central Europe, Global)
  - Material (Aluminum, Steel, Composite)

- In the public site:
  - Users can filter content by tags or use multi-select filters
  - Filters should be responsive and intuitive (dropdowns or buttons)

- In admin:
  - Tags can be added/edited per item
  - Filtering in tables/lists helps internal management too

---

🕓 3. Lead Timeline + CRM Archive

In each CRM Lead profile, add a **timeline view** of interactions:

- Show:
  - Quote submitted
  - Offer generated/sent
  - Status changed
  - Internal comment added
  - Follow-up scheduled

- Add "Archived" status for closed leads with full data preservation
- Timeline should be editable (for notes) and automatically populated by actions

---

📝 4. Task Manager / To-Do System (per client or general)

Add a lightweight task system inside the CRM:

- Admin can add tasks related to a lead or offer:
  - e.g., “Call client on May 22”, “Recalculate delivery for Latvia”
- Fields:
  - Task title
  - Due date/time
  - Assigned user (if multi-user)
  - Status: Pending / Done
- Show tasks in CRM dashboard or per lead
- Optional: reminders or color-coded statuses

---

📊 5. Weekly Analytics & Reports (PDF/CSV)

Enable automated report generation with stats from CRM and Offers:

- Create a “Generate Weekly Report” button in Analytics or CRM tab
- Reports include:
  - Number of leads
  - Number of offers sent
  - Conversion rate
  - Country distribution
  - Top products / tags
- Exportable as PDF and CSV
- Optional: auto-send to predefined email addresses

---

✨ BONUS: Admin UX Onboarding & Tooltips

Add subtle onboarding guidance for first-time users or empty states:

- Show tooltips or hints:
  - “Start by adding your first product”
  - “No projects yet — use the + button to create one”
- Add “Help” icon or hover tooltips on key features (e.g., PDF button, CRM status)
- Use icons and soft animations to keep it friendly, not disruptive

---

✅ Final Notes:

- All changes must follow MetaNord design and translation logic
- Multilingual support must remain intact for all content types
- Data should be persistent and exportable
- Keep UI fast, mobile-responsive, and intuitive

Let me know when all upgrades are complete and tested.
