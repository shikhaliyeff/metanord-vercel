Please extend the admin console with full control and visibility over the entire website, and activate the "Contact Inquiries" system.

Here is what I need:

---

🧭 1. Pages Tab with Full Website Navigation

Create a new tab in the admin dashboard called **"Pages"**.

It should:

- Display a list of all public-facing pages (index.html, about.html, contact.html, etc.)
- For each page, show the related editable content sections pulled from content.json, hero.json, etc.
- Allow switching between pages from a side menu or tab system

---

🖼 2. Live Preview Integration

- When selecting any page from the "Pages" tab, show a live visual preview using an `<iframe>` (e.g. `<iframe src="/about.html">`)
- Make the preview reflect dynamic content pulled from JSON (i.e., current live data as edited through admin)
- Allow toggling between preview and edit modes for a smoother workflow

---

🌐 3. Dynamic JSON Integration (Frontend ↔ Admin)

Ensure that all public site pages dynamically load their content from JSON using client-side JavaScript:

- `hero.json` → homepage hero section
- `products.json` → product listings
- `content.json` → about, contact, certificates, footer, and other static blocks

This way, all website content is updated live based on edits from the admin panel.

📬 4. Contact Inquiries — Functional Viewer + Email Notifications

Activate and fully implement the **"Contact Inquiries"** system:

- When a user submits the contact form on the website, save their inquiry (name, email, subject, message, timestamp)
- Show a full list of submitted inquiries inside the "Contact Inquiries" tab in the admin console
- Include details such as: sender name, email, date/time, and message body
- Optional but helpful: ability to mark inquiries as “read” or “replied”

➕ Additionally:
- Set up email forwarding: when a contact form is submitted, send a copy of the inquiry to my email address (e.g. info@metanord.eu) using Replit-compatible email sending method (e.g. EmailJS, SMTP with nodemailer, or webhook to Zapier)

---

🔒 5. General Requirements

- Keep authentication and styling consistent with the current admin layout
- This expansion should give me complete centralized visibility and editing capabilities across all pages, all sections, and user inquiries

Let me know if you need email configuration details or example message structure.
