Please clean up and restore the MetaNord admin panel by doing the following:

---

🔧 1. Remove all unused or placeholder tabs that are not part of MetaNord’s actual workflow.

This includes:
- Settings
- Media
- Navigation
- Team (if present and not functional)
- Any tab currently showing “This feature is under development” with no implemented functionality

The “Navigation” tab was likely added as boilerplate. MetaNord uses a fixed navigation structure in the frontend, so this section should be removed entirely.

---

🎨 2. Repurpose the “Themes” tab (or rename it to “Templates”) to function as a reusable layout library for future pages.

This section should:

- Present 3–5 ready-made visual templates styled according to MetaNord’s design system
- Each template must include:
   - Template name
   - Visual preview
   - “Use This Template” button

Initial templates should include:
- Hero with headline, subtitle, background image, and 2 CTA buttons
- Product highlight block with icons and description
- Gallery layout for project showcases
- Grid of partner or client logos
- Contact form with embedded map
- Split layout for “Why MetaNord” section

These templates will be used later for building new landing pages or content sections. They must match MetaNord’s visual branding.

---

🔁 3. Fully restore all previously working editors and reconnect them to their actual data.

Restore and reactivate:

- Hero Section Editor (with multilingual support + live preview)
- Pages / Content Blocks Editor
- Products Editor (with drag-and-drop image upload, import/export)
- Featured Projects Editor (with multilingual inputs and status control)
- CRM: Leads, Client Profiles, Offers
- Contact Inquiries with SendGrid email and auto-reply system
- PDF Offer Generator
- Analytics and Audit Logs
- Global Notification Bell with dropdown and mark-as-read

Reconnect editors to their respective files:
- `hero.json`, `content.json`, `products.json`, `projects.json`, etc.

Ensure all real content is displayed. Remove all placeholder messages like “Feature is under development”.
