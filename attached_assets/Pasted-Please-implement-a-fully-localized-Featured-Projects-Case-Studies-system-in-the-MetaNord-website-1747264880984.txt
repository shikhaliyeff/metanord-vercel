Please implement a fully localized “Featured Projects” (Case Studies) system in the MetaNord website and admin panel.

---

📁 1. Admin Panel – Featured Projects (inside “Site Content” tab)

- In the existing “Site Content” tab, add a collapsible section titled **“Featured Projects”**
- Allow the admin to:
  - View, create, and edit project entries
  - Each project should support the following fields:
    - Title (multilingual)
    - Year
    - Location (City, Country)
    - Short summary (multilingual)
    - Full description (multilingual)
    - Product tags or categories
    - Image gallery (upload or link)
    - Visibility toggle (published/unpublished)
- Store this in `projects.json`, using the same multilingual structure as `hero.json` or `content.json`
- Example:
```json
{
  "title": {
    "en": "Tallinn Business Tower",
    "ru": "Бизнес-центр в Таллине",
    "et": "Tallinna ärikeskus",
    "lv": "Tallinas biznesa tornis",
    "lt": "Talino verslo bokštas",
    "pl": "Wieża Biznesowa w Tallinie"
  }
}
🌐 2. Public Page /projects

Create a fully localized page at /projects

Automatically detect or allow switching between 6 languages:

English (EN), Russian (RU), Estonian (ET), Latvian (LV), Lithuanian (LT), Polish (PL)

Show all published projects as cards:

Thumbnail

Localized title, summary, year, location

Button: “View Project” (also localized)

Clicking a project leads to a localized detail view:

Full description

Gallery

Tags or products used

All content in the correct selected language

🔗 3. Link Homepage “View Project” Buttons

On the homepage, in the Featured Projects section:

Each “View Project” button should link directly to the corresponding localized project page

Maintain correct language context when navigating from homepage → project

📦 4. Pre-Fill Sample Projects

Create and insert 4–5 sample case studies using realistic MetaNord business content

Localize all content (titles, summaries, descriptions) into all 6 supported languages

Use royalty-free or placeholder images relevant to aluminum profiles, façades, and lighting

Tag products used, assign location and year

Mark all demo projects as “Published”

🧩 Notes:

Do not create a new main tab — keep this under “Site Content”

Use existing translation switching logic used for Hero and other sections

Ensure /projects and individual project pages correctly reflect the selected language

Ensure fallback to English if translation is missing
