üìä 3. Audit Trail / Action Log

Track and display admin activity across the platform.

Required features:

üß© Notes:

- Keep all UI elements consistent with current design
- Use existing authentication/role logic for permissions (e.g. Viewers can't generate offers or view logs)
- Store logs in a structured `audit.json` or similar file
- All notifications and logs should persist on reload

Let me know if you need offer layout examples, email templates, or notification icons.
