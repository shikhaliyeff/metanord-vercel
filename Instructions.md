# MetaNord Website Translation and Layout Fixes

## Overview of Issues

Based on the screenshots and analysis of the codebase, there are several critical issues with the Chinese (zh-CN) translation implementation and mobile layout that need to be addressed:

### 1. Missing/Incomplete Translations
- Homepage: "Request a Quote Today", "Ready to Start Your Project?", bullet points, button labels, and paragraphs
- About Page: "Our Vision", "Our Story", stats like "15+ European Countries" and subheadings 
- Projects Page: Page title, descriptions, category filters, empty state messages, project cards
- Contact Page: "Reach Out" header and form field labels (Company, Address, etc.)
- Services Section: "Technical Consulting" heading and feature bullets

### 2. Layout Issues
- Hero Slider Pagination Dots: Mobile version uses older fat circle style vs. the newer, slim desktop version

## Root Causes

After examining the codebase, I've identified the following root causes:

1. **Incomplete Translation Files**: The `zh-CN.json` file is missing key entries needed for various sections of the website.

2. **Inconsistent Translation Keys**: Some components use translation keys that don't exist in the Chinese translation file.

3. **Hardcoded English Text**: Some text is hardcoded in English rather than using translation keys.

4. **Pagination Dots Styling**: The mobile and desktop pagination dots in the Hero slider have different styling implementations.

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Translation Fixes

1. **Complete Missing Translations in zh-CN.json**:
   - Add missing translation keys for homepage content ("Request a Quote Today", "Ready to Start Your Project?", etc.)
   - Add missing translations for About page ("Our Vision", "Our Story", stats)
   - Add missing translations for Projects page (filter labels, empty states)
   - Add missing translations for Contact page header and form labels
   - Add missing translations for Services section headings and bullet points

2. **Fix Inconsistent Translation Keys**:
   - Ensure all components are using the correct translation keys that exist in the zh-CN.json file
   - Standardize key naming conventions across components

3. **Replace Hardcoded English Text**:
   - Convert any hardcoded English text to use the i18n translation system properly

### 2. Layout Fixes

1. **Unify Pagination Dots Style**:
   - Update the mobile pagination dots styling to match the slim style used on desktop
   - Ensure consistent styling across all viewports by modifying the Hero.tsx component

## Files to Modify

Based on my analysis, the following files will need to be modified:

1. **Translation File**:
   - `client/src/locales/zh-CN.json` - Add missing translations

2. **Component Files**:
   - `client/src/components/sections/Hero.tsx` - Fix pagination dots styling and ensure proper translation usage
   - `client/src/pages/About.tsx` - Ensure proper translation of stats and headings
   - `client/src/pages/Projects.tsx` - Fix translations of category filters and empty states
   - `client/src/pages/Contact.tsx` - Fix "Reach Out" header and form labels translation
   - `client/src/components/sections/Services.tsx` - Fix technical consulting heading and bullet points

## Implementation Plan

1. First, update the `zh-CN.json` file with all missing translations
2. Fix component files to ensure proper use of translation keys
3. Update the Hero component pagination dots styling to be consistent across all screen sizes
4. Test all pages on both desktop and mobile to ensure translations are properly applied and layouts are consistent
5. Verify that no working translations have been disrupted, especially Products and FAQs sections
